Real Estate made easy 
Long and repetitive texts/points & important texts are hard to read due to a light grey color with the white background
The average time Investors look at pitch decks is 3 minutes and 44 seconds. Pitch deck is long and takes at least 10 minutes to read. We tried to minimize the number of words:
Added “Team” into “what makes us different” section
Cut amount of words in each section (data with numbers should be shown in infographics)
Structured Presentation - the most important points are being shown in the beginning

Professional Tools for Realtors
We understand that finding or selling your home requires People and Technology. We provide tools for realtors to help with leads, listings, marketing and software needs at a fraction of the cost.

Business Model:
The one-stop-shop for everyone involved: buyers, sellers, renters, and agents. 

SUBSCRIPTION AS A SERVICE
There are 2 million active realtors. Since consumers don't buy frequently, we want to empower agents who are responsible for 98% of deals today.

MARKETING TOOLS
Agents are great at relationships, soft skills, sales, but lack marketing skills and tech. We want to automate marketing tools and analytics for agents.

SALES COMMISSION
Once automated, we can represent both sides of the deal and save money. Currently, each side of the deal gets 3% each, totaling 6% of the price.

DATA
Real Estate marketplace is full of DATA that can be monetized.

Market Adaptation:

Work with Realtors
Realtors are unhappy with the current market leader due to unethical business model. We have the opportunity to be a realtor-friendly platform.

Work with Brokerages
Work with brokerages to offer company-wide deals. Big 4 has a market share of 33%.

Work with Buildings/Developers
Since market leader charges for listings, we can work with big buildings that have hundreds of units and no proper salesman.

Team:
The cost of running a Startup is 10 times cheaper with the remote teams. Yurtah is built by a team in the leading Technology hub of Central Asia.
